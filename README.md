# How do we empower you? 

VTEX Toolbelt is a command-line program that gives you access to all of 
the features in the VTEX platform and increases your productivity, allowing you to:

- **Manage your apps quickly:** List, install and uninstall available apps in your account;
- **Work safely on your personal environments:** List, create and remove workspaces;
- **Easily ship changes to your final user:** Promote a workspace toÂ `master`, making it public in your account URL;
- **See what you are creating in real time:** Develop new apps in link mode, using automatic synchronization;
- **Go live from the command line:** Publish apps to the VTEX App Store.

# Getting started: Installing the VTEX Toolbelt
To use the VTEX Toolbelt, you'll need to install other engines 
that will also be useful when developing for VTEX.

#### Node.js to run the tool
- Install Node.js [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/): Toolbelt is written in Typescript and designed to run on Node.js. 
(Node is the runtime that executes the JS and allows our tool to run and work at your computer) 
- Install yarn [here](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install): yarn is a way to manage your code, organize content in packages 
that you can download, share and... install, just like our CLI :) 

Now do you have Node.js and Yarn? Let's install the Toolbelt. 

#### Installing the Toolbelt with yarn
`yarn` powers app development to React, Node and VTEX IO! Install the Toolbelt using yarn and start working with us generating automatically all the files you'll need to create apps in the future. 
To install it, run: 
 
 ```
 yarn global add vtex
 ```

<details>
  <summary>Alternative installation method using npm</summary>
  You can install usingÂ `npm`. But remember, if in the future 
  you want to develop a VTEX IO app, you'll need to install `yarn` 

  To install with `npm`, run:

  ```
  npm install -g vtex
  ```
</details>

# Using the CLI 

After installation, run `vtex` to see our commands and what each one of them does.

# Second step: log into your VTEX account

Start by usingÂ `vtex login`Â to receive your credentials and be able 
to access other features. Simply type this command and follow the instructions.

<details>
<summary>Having trouble with login? Follow these steps</summary>

You can useÂ `vtex login`Â to login with your VTEX ID credentials orÂ vtex logoutÂ if you're already logged in and want to change credentials.

When logging in, you will be asked forÂ 3Â things:
- TheÂ `account`Â name of the store you wish to work on, that would be your company's or client's `account` name;
- Your VTEX IDÂ email, the one you received access to work with VTEX.
- Your VTEX IDÂ password, the one you chose when creating your user. 

If you wish to work on anotherÂ `account`, run `vtex switch <account>` specifying the account you want to move to.

</details>

> ðŸ˜‰ Note thatÂ `link`Â andÂ `publish`Â implicitly checks if you're logged, and if you're not, it asks your credentials before proceeding.

# To develop locally: use vtex link

When you log in to an account, you can create your own workspaces to work on your ideas or see what is in production. To do so:

1. On an app directory, runÂ `vtex link`Â and click on or copy the provided URL into your browser;
2. Now on, VTEX Toolbelt will monitor your files for change and sync them with what you see automatically. 

<details>
<summary>Know more about local development with Toolbelt</summary>

Toolbelt will upload all your app files to the developer environment, print an URL for your use, and watch for any changes you make to the files, which will be automatically synchronized.

</details>


# Wanna know something cool? You can customize your prompt

You can configure yourÂ **terminal prompt**Â to display relevant information about your current context, like whichÂ accountÂ you're logged into and whichÂ `workspace`Â you are currently using.

Just like knowing which `git` branch you're currently in, having this info in your prompt will help you avoid mistakes and be faster when using VTEX IO.

## How to do so? 

#### `bash` users

If you are a bash user you can start customizing your command prompt by running the following command:

```sh
echo "source $(npm root -g)/vtex/plugins/bash/vtex.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
echo "source $(npm root -g)/vtex/plugins/bash/prompt.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
```

> ðŸ˜‰ For fine grained control, use only the first script and add `__vtex_ps1` manually to your prompt.

#### `fish` users

If you want a pretty, ready-made Git + VTEX prompt you can copy `plugins/fish/fish_prompt.fish` to the  `~/.config/fish/functions` folder. To see the changes, simply restart your shell by typing `fish`.

```sh
cp (npm root -g)/vtex/plugins/fish/fish_prompt.fish ~/.config/fish/functions/
fish
```

> ðŸ’¡ If you installed Toolbelt using `yarn`, you should replace `(npm root -g)` with `(yarn global dir)`.

# Frequently Asked Questions

<details>
<summary>How do I ignore specific files or directories in my app so that they are not uploaded?</summary>

Create a `.vtexignore` file containing, on each line, paths you wish to ignore.
If no `.vtexignore` is found, your [.gitignore](http://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore) file is used instead.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Is there another way to customize the prompt?</summary>

You can do so by adding the `vtex_get_account` and `vtex_get_workspace` commands to your PS1 environment variable the way it pleases you.

</details>
