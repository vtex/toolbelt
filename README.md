[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/vtex/toolbelt.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/vtex/toolbelt) [![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/vtex.svg?style=flat)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vtex) [![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/vtex/toolbelt.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

All you need to start using the VTEX platform.

### What is this?

VTEX Toolbelt is a command-line program that gives you access to all of the features in the VTEX platform.

With it you can:

- List, install and uninstall available apps in your account.
- List, create and remove workspaces.
- Promote a workspace to `master`, making it public in your account URL.
- Develop new apps in link mode, using automatic synchronization.
- Publish apps to the VTEX App Store.

# Getting started

The VTEX Toolbelt can be installed via [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/).
If you don't have it installed, you can get it bundled with [node](https://nodejs.org/):
 - [Linux](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/)
 - [Mac and Windows](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

## Installing the VTEX Toolbelt

It's recommended that you install it globally using `yarn`:

```sh
yarn global add vtex
```

Or, using `npm`:

```sh
npm install -g vtex
```

Now you can use the `vtex` command:

```
$ vtex

## Login

Start by using `vtex login` to receive your credentials and be able to access other features.
Simply type this command and follow the instructions.

## Using link

On an app directory, run `vtex link` and click on or copy the provided URL into your browser.

VTEX Toolbelt will now monitor your files for changes and sync them automatically.

## Customizing your prompt

You can configure your **terminal prompt** to display relevant information about your current context, like  which **account** you're logged into and which **workspace** you are currently using.

Just like knowing which `git` branch you're currently in, having this info in your prompt you help you avoid mistakes and be faster when using VTEX IO.

### `bash` users

If you are a _bash_ user you can customize your command prompt by running the following command:

```sh
echo "source $(npm root -g)/vtex/plugins/bash/vtex.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
echo "source $(npm root -g)/vtex/plugins/bash/prompt.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
```

For fine grained control, use only the first script and add `__vtex_ps1` manually to your prompt.

### `fish` users

If you want a pretty, ready-made Git + VTEX prompt you can copy `plugins/fish/fish_prompt.fish` to the  `~/.config/fish/functions` folder. To see the changes, simply restart your shell by typing `fish`.

```sh
cp (npm root -g)/vtex/plugins/fish/fish_prompt.fish ~/.config/fish/functions/
fish
```

PS: If you used `yarn` to install, you should replace `(npm root -g)` with `(yarn global dir)`.

# Frequently Asked Questions

## How do I login?

You can use `vtex login` to login with your VTEX ID credentials or `vtex logout` if you're already logged in and want to change credentials.

When logging in, you will be asked for **3** things:

- The `account` name of the store you wish to work on
- Your VTEX ID `e-mail`
- Your VTEX ID `password`

If you wish to work on another `account`, logout and login again with that `account`.

Note that `link` and `publish` implicitly checks if you're logged, and if you're not, it asks your credentials before proceeding.


## How do I develop an app locally?

To develop an app locally, open the directory where your VTEX app is and then type:

```sh
vtex link
```

Toolbelt will upload all your app files to the developer environment, print an URL for your use and watch for any changes you make to the files, which will be automatically synchronized.

## How do I ignore specific files or directories in my app so that they are not uploaded?

Create a `.vtexignore` file containing, on each line, paths you wish to ignore.
If no `.vtexignore` is found, your [.gitignore](http://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore) file is used instead.


## How do I publish my App to the VTEX App Store?

To publish your VTEX app to VTEX App Store, use the `vtex publish` command. The app will be published under the vendor name.


## I don't like the default toolbelt prompt customization. It's ugly or it messes with some of my other configurations, but I still want to be able to see the account and workspace I'm logged into. What do I do?

You can do so by adding the `vtex_get_account` and `vtex_get_workspace` commands to your PS1 environment variable the way it pleases you.
